Offer Builder is an open-source tool for creating commercial offers, which is currently being utilized internally by [OMR Capital](https://omrcapital.ru/).

The project has been published to showcase my coding skills and serve as a reference for future projects. Please note that as a real-world business tool under active development, some parts of the code might be temporarily suboptimal due to time constraints. I plan to allocate time to address these issues in the future.

Additionally, this project can serve as a reference for running full-stack applications on the [Deta Space](https://deta.space/) platform.
